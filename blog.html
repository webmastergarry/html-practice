		<p> <!--Start Paragraph-->
		The importance of cybersecurity cannot be understated. Everyday, we face attacks as individuals, groups and nations by people that want to steal, destroy or control. <br/> <!--BreakLine-->
		As cybersecurity students and experts, it is our job to protect not only ourselves, others or our country, but the safety of humanity as a whole.
		</p> <!--End Paragraph-->

		You might think to yourself: "What can I do? What would make me any good in cybersecurity? Isn't hacking only for geniuses?" <br/> <!--Since <br/> doesnt have an end, nothing between is an element.-->
		There is only one truth - everyone can take a part. While we may not all be the next Kevin Mitnick, Edward Snowden or even Anonymous, we all have a part to play, no matter
		how little it may be. Everyone can learn basic cybersecurity - the area you reach is entirely dependent on your passion and persistance.
		It requires coding until your fingers go numb, it requires throwing yourself into risky territory and it requires a will to do good. <br/>
		I believe it is everyone's best interest and duty to protect those we love - we are solgiers, we are warriors and we are fighters. <br/>
		We are the sword and shield in the era of computers - and we must fight for what's right. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		It is our duty. It is our will. It is our passion. <br/>
		We will not stop, we will not give up and we will not surrender. <br/>
		<i>And it begins, one script at a time.<i/>
